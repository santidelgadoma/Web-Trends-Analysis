# Web Trends Analysis

## Introduction

This project came about after a friend studying economics contacted me to help him obtain data from pytrends to create a timeline for web searches including certain words.

## Python 

The code is completely developed in python and presentend in csv files that allow the user to load them into other data analysis programs like R Studio or Stata.
It's implemented to analyze certain words already declared in an array, modify these to adapt it to your use case.
